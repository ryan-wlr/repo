# repo
## Ubuntu 16.04 ROS Kinetic Project
### This project uses Moveit and has those dependencies.
Install Moveit and create a ws_moveit repository following the directions on dot org site. 
If the project won't run after install, make sure to Google missing packages or dependencies. 
I used Google Chrome: "ros wiki <package>" as the search. I think the missing dependencies should be red text in command prompt. 
Once downloading missing dependencies from github paste them into the ws_moveit/src directory.. 
To run this project use the commands 1.) catkin_make 2.) source devel/setup.bash 3.) roslaunch my_one_robot_revolute demo.launch
